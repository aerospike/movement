Movement: A system for moving data from an emitter to an output via an encoder.

emiter-encoder-output triples are organized in one or more concurrent pipelines.

A Work Chunk Driver drives the system forward, and an Output ID Driver provides an id for every emittable written to the output.

NOTE: Movement is not yet ready for business critical applications. It is currently intended for Testing and Research purposes.
